        Makkah is the holiest city for Muslims. It embraces Masjid Al Haram (the
        GreatMosque) and Kaaba, the qiblah for Muslims to which they turn in
        their prayers. Muslims yearn to visit Makkah to perform Hajj or Umrah.
        In this city, Prophet Muhammad, the most honorable of creation, the seal
        of the prophets and messengers, our master Muhammad, peace be upon him,
        was born, and from it, the tolerant message of Islam was launched to all
        corners of the world after the Holy Quran was revealed. Makkah is
        located in the western part of Saudi Arabia. During the reign of the
        kings of Saudi Arabia, it received great interest. Makkah still enjoys
        great attention to provide the best services to pilgrims. Its most
        prominent landmark, Masjid Al Haram, witnessed many expansions that
        included all parts of the mosque, and the holy sites received a series
        of development works to provide all means of comfort and reassurance for
        all pilgrims from inside and outside the Kingdom.
