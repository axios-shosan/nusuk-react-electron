      'Upon reaching Masjid al-Haram, Tawaf is performed by circling the Kaaba seven times,  Pilgrims and Umrah performers begin their Tawaf (circumambulation) from the corner opposite the Black Stone. When they are aligned with the Black Stone, they say: "bismillah Allahu Akbar (In the name of God, God is the Greatest) and continue their Tawaf. When they reach the Yemeni Corner, they wipe over it if possible and say: “Our Lord, give us good in this world and good in the Hereafter, and protect us from the torment of the Fire.” They repeat this  supplication until they reach the Black Stone.',

It has four corners, namely: the Eastern Corner, next to the door of the Kaaba, and it includes the black stone, and Tawaf starts from there. Then there is the Iraqi Corner, then the Western Corner, and the Yemeni Corner which parallels the corner of the Black Stone.',
