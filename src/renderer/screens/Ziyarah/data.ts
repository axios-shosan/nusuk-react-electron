    text: [
      'Madinah is the second holiest site in Islam. It is described as Al-Munawwarah (enlightened). It is also called “the home of migration” because it had the honor of receiving the Prophet of God, peace be upon him, and Tibah (goodness) because of its beauty, splendor, purity of its soil, and the goodness of living in it. God has singled it out with many virtues, including that it is blessed by the supplication of the Prophet, who said, “Oh God, bless our fruits, and bless our Madinah.” It is the home of Islam and guidance, and a sacred city in which good deeds are multiplied and evils magnified.',
      `Madinah includes the Prophet's Mosque, the second greatest mosque in Islam after Masjid Al Haram. It was built by the Prophet and his companions after they migrated to Madinah, and it has many advantages and virtues, which confirm the great reward of visiting, building, expanding and maintaining it, and serving its visitors pilgrims. It is the mosque that was founded on piety from the first day. God Almighty says in the Holy Quran: " Do not stand [for prayer] within it - ever. A mosque founded on righteousness from the first day is more worthy for you to stand in. Within it are men who love to purify themselves, and Allah loves those who purify themselves." (Al Tawbah, 108). Moreover, the virtue of praying in it is better than a thousand prayers in any other mosque except Masjid Al Haram. The Prophet, peace be upon him, said, “A prayer in this mosque of mine is better than a thousand prayers in any other mosque except Masjid Al Haram.”`,

      `After Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, arrived in Madinah, he helped build the Prophet's Mosque. Muslims should travel to pray there if they can. The Prophet, peace be upon him, said: “Do not travel except to three mosques: Masjid Al-Haram, this mosque of mine, and Al-Aqsa Mosque.” The Prophet's Mosque includes the tomb of the Prophet, peace be upon him, located under the mosque's only green dome in the southeast corner of it.`,
      `The mosque was expanded more than once by the kings of Saudi Arabia. It covers an area of 500,000 square meters and can accommodate one million worshipers. It has 229 doors, 196 fixed and movable domes, 262 umbrellas, and 10 minarets. It is open around the clock.`,

    text: [
      `It is the house in which the Prophet, may peace and prayers be upon him, lived with the Mother of Believers Aisha bint Abi Bakr al-Siddiq, may Allah be pleased with them. It is located in the southeast side of the Prophet's Mosque. The Prophet died and was buried in this Chamber in the direction of the Qibla. When Abu Bakr al-Siddiq died, he was buried behind the Prophet, and when Omar ibn Al-Khattab died, he was buried there, as well. The Sacred Chamber has six doors: The southern door, the Door of Repentance; the northern door, the Door of Tahajjud; the eastern door, the Door of Fatima; the western door, the Door of the Prophet or the “Door of Delegations”; in addition to tow doors, one to the right and the other to the left of the triangle inside the Chamber.`,
      `It is desirable for those who come to Madinah to visit the tomb of the Prophet, peace be upon him, and greet him. This is done by entering from Al Salam Gate at the front of the mosque and walking forward quietly. When the visitor reaches the opposite of the Prophet's room, he/she stands for a short time and greets the Prophet saying: “Peace be upon you, O Prophet, and so is Allah's mercy and blessings.” Then he takes a step and greets Abu Bakr Al Siddiq, then he takes another step and greets Omar Ibn Al Khattab.`,
      `Visitors of the Prophet's tomb should avoid raising their voices or wiping the tomb or its surroundings. They also should not ask the Prophet, peace be upon him, to realize a need, relieve a distressed person, or heal a sick person because such things are requested only from God Almighty. Then, visitors leave with serenity and dignity to make room for those behind them awaiting their turn to greet the Prophet.`,

      `To pray in Ar-Rawdhah, you need a permit that can easily be obtained by making an appointment using the Nusuk app.`,
      `Al Rawda al-Sharifa (The honorable Rawda) is located at the front of the Prophet's Mosque. It extends from the Prophet's home to his minbar (pulpit). The Prophet, peace be upon him, said, “Between my house and my minbar is one of the gardens of Paradise.” It is a place of great value and impact on the soul because the Prophet and his companions used to pray and supplicate there. Al Rawda is rectangular with a length of about 26.5 m. It is now defined by green carpets that are different from the rest of the carpets of the Prophet's Mosque. It has a number of landmarks: the Prophet's minbar and mihrab.`,
      `Booking a visit to Ar-Rawdhah Ash-Shareefah and a prayer time can be made through Nusuk app.`,

      It is the pulpit on which the Prophet, may peace and prayers be upon him, used to stand to deliver sermons. It was two cubits, one span, and three fingers long, and one cubit wide. It was developed over the years and received attention from the Saudi Government. About its virtues, the Prophet, may peace and prayers be upon him, said (Between my house and my pulpit is one of the gardens of Paradise, and my pulpit is on a canal of the canals of Paradise), and the canal is: A garden on a high place.`,

      `It is the place designated for imam during the congregational prayers in the mosque. During the time of the Prophet, the mihraab had no sign that distinguished it from other parts of the mosque, and the place where the Prophet stood to lead prayers was called a mihraab. The Prophetic Mihraab is located in the Ar-Rawdhah Ash-Shareefah, to the left of the pulpit. The imam of the Prophet's Mosque stands in the Prophetic Mihraab to lead prayers.
