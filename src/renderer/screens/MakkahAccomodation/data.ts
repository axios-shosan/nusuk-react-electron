    title: 'Mina',
    description: `A stage of Hajj journey. It is characterized by white tents. It has recently won the Guinness World Records Award for the largest tent city in the world. It provides many services, including the Mashaer Train, housing camps, catering, transportation system, integrated electricity system, and interconnected road network. Pilgrims usually spend the Day of Tarwiyah (the eighth day of Dhu al-Hijjah) there and return to Mina again to spend Day of Nahr (the tenth day of Dhu al-Hijjah) and the three days of Tashreeq (the eleventh, the twelfth, and thirteenth days of Dhul-Hijjah). Mina is the first stage of Hajj. It has a historical and religious status. It is famous for archaeological landmarks and historical events, as it is located within the boundaries of the Haram between Makkah and Muzdalifah, 7 km to the northeast of the Holy Mosque. Mina also includes the extension of “Ain Zubaida,” in addition to some old wells, including the well of Kadana. Mina is famous for the historical seasonal markets, including the Arab Market, which was given this name because most Arab pilgrims used to display their goods at this market from the tenth day to the thirteenth day of Dhu al-Hijjah.`,

    title: 'Arafah',
    description: `One of the stages of the pilgrim’s journey. It occurs on the ninth day of Dhu al-Hijjah, where pilgrims stand at Arafah. The Prophet, may peace and prayers be upon him, said: (Hajj is Arafah). That is why it is called the Greatest Day of Hajj. Standing at Arafah and supplication anywhere within the boundaries of Arafah or the Mountain of Mercy are allowed on the day of Arafah. On the day of Arafah, pilgrims join and shorten zuhr prayer and asr prayer. The prayer has a sermon as the Prophet, may peace and prayers be upon him, did as he performed Hajj, delivered a sermon, and led Muslims in his last farewell Hajj. Pilgrims start to depart Arafat to head to Muzdalifah after the sunset. The day of Arafah has great virtues, as the Prophet, may peace and prayers be upon him, said that the day of Arafah is the best day for Allah.`,

    title: 'Namirah Mosque',
    description: `A mosque that was built in Arafah where the Prophet, may peace and prayers be upon him, delivered a sermon for the last farewell Hajj. In Namirah Mosque, thousands of pilgrims pray zuhr and asr prayers on the day of Arafah. It is located to the west of Arafah. The western part of the Mosque is located in Wadi ‘Arnah, which is a valley of Makkah Al-Mukarramah where the Prophet prohibited pilgrims from standing there because it is not a part of Arafat, but it is very close thereto. Namirah Mosque is known in many books by several other names, such as the Mosque of the Prophet Ibrahim, Arafah Mosque, and Arnah Mosque. The name Arafah Mosque was originated from a village outside Arafah Area where the Prophet, may peace and prayers be upon him, resided and then moved to the valley, where he prayed zuhr and asr prayers and delivered a sermon in the Mosque. During the era of the Saudi State, the Mosque witnessed the largest expansions in history, where it became the second largest mosque in Makkah in terms of area after the Holy Mosque. The length of the Mosque from east to west is 340 meters, and the width from north to south is 240 meters. Its area is more than 110,000 square meters. Behind the Mosque, there is a shaded area of 8 thousand square meters. The Mosque accommodates about 350 thousand worshippers. It has six minarets and an equipped outside broadcasting room for broadcasting the sermon and zuhr and asr prayers on the day of Arafat, directly by satellite.`,

    title: 'Jamarat',
    description: `One of the most prominent landmarks of Mina is the Jamarat or the Jamrah Pillars that are thrown at the Jamarat Bridge. The three Jamarat are located in Mina Valley. Currently, they are within the Jamarat Bridge, which is one of the great achievements of the Kingdom’s Government, in order to organize crowds and provide safety when they go to throw Jamarat. At the beginning of the Day of Nahr, only the seven pebbles of the biggest Jamrah are thrown. During the days of Tashreeq, each Jamrah is thrown at with seven pebbles, from the Smallest Jamrah, the Middle Jamrah, and finally the Biggest Jamrah. A pilgrim can throw Jamarat from any floor of the Jamarat Bridge. It is very important for pilgrims to abide by the schedule of Tafweej (Group Dispatching) set by the organizers for throwing Jamarat and the directions of movement, in order to maintain the safety and security of others. The Jamarat Bridge is one of the pioneering projects that has made a civilizational and engineering leap in the service of pilgrims. The Jamarat Facility consists of four floors, in addition to the ground floor. It is 80 meters wide and has 12 entrances for Jamarat and 12 exits in the four directions, which reduces overcrowding. The Bridge is linked to the pilgrim camps.`,
