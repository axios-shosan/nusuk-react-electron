    title: `World's Largest Clock Tower`,
    description: `Makkah Clock Royal Tower rises more than 400 meters above ground. It is the largest clock tower in the world, with a diameter of more than 40 meters. The clock weighs 36 thousand tons. The clock can be seen from all areas of Makkah al-Mukarramah from a distance of more than eight kilometers. The clock consists of four interfaces, and the largest word (Allah is Great) in the world can be seen above the clock, where the letter (A) in the word (Allah) is more than 23 meters long. The diameter of the crescent is 23 meters, constituting the largest crescent that has been made so far. The two testimonies of faith (I testify that there is none worthy of worship except Allah and that Muhammad is His slave and messenger) can also be seen. The clock was designed in the Islamic style according to the strictest safety standards.`,

    title: 'Museums',
    description: `Makkah has a host of fascinating, intimate museums that shed light on the city’s history as the birthplace of Islam and a crossroads for travelers from all over the world for centuries. The Exhibition of the Two Holy Mosques guides visitors through the construction and many phases of the Masjid Al Haram in Makkah as well as the Masjid An Nabawi in Medina—browse intricate marble arches, reclaimed wooden doors and much more, saved and restored from previous iterations of the mosques. You’ll have to get permission to visit the Kiswah Museum next door—though it’s well worth to see where the kiswah, the 670-kilogram black silk cloth draped on the Kaaba, is made by hand, and woven with calligraphic inscriptions done in threads made from real gold and silver. At the Makkah Museum, set in the opulent Al Zahir Palace, you can learn about the region’s pre-Islamic history, dating back to ancient rock art, and see some early-Islamic coins from Byzantine, Abbasid and Umayyad dynasties as well as rare copies of centuries-old Qurans and other important texts.`,

    title: 'Jabal al-Noor (Mount of Light)',
    description: `The place where Jibreel first met the Prophet, may peace and prayers be upon him, and revealed to him the opening verses of the Qur’an (Recite in the name of your Lord who created). It is located 4 kilometers away from the northeastern side of the Holy Mosque. It was called Jabal al-Noor, as the lights of prophecy emerged there. Its height is 642 meters. It has a steep slope from 380 meters to 500 meters above sea level. It is five kilometers long and 250 meters wide. Its top resembles the camel's hump. In Jabal al-Noor, there is the Cave of Hiraa, which is one of the most important places in the history of Islam and the prophecy, as the Prophet, may peace and prayers be upon him, used to seclude himself to worship Allah before the prophecy, away from the people of Makkah. It is a gap at the top of Jabal al-Noor. Its entrance faces the northern direction, and it is four cubits long and one and three-fourths cubits wide. A person who enters the Cave faces the Kaaba. Whoever stands at the top of Jabal al-Noor can see Makkah and its buildings.`,

    title: 'Kiswah (Covering) of the Kaaba',
    description: `The Kiswah of the Kaaba is an integral part of the history of the Kaaba itself. It consists of black silk on which verses from the Holy Qur’an are embroidered with gold water. It consists of four pieces distributed on the faces of the Kaaba, in addition to a fifth piece, which is a curtain on the door of the Kaaba.

    title: 'Door of the Kaaba',
    description: `It is located in the eastern side of the Kaaba. It rises from the ground by more than 222 cm from Shazrawan. The door is 318 cm high, 170 cm wide, and about half a meter deep. Previously, the Kaaba had a hole to enter it, which was then replaced with a door, which had a long history and has been changed several times. King Abdulaziz bin Abdul Rahman Al Saud, may his soul rest in peace, commanded that a new door be manufactured in 1363 AH. It was then made of aluminum with a thickness of 2.5 cm and a height of 3.10 meters. It was supported with bars of iron. Then, the outer face of the door was covered with plates of silver plated with gold. The door was decorated with the fine names of Allah. During the reign of King Khalid bin Abdul Aziz Al Saud, may Allah have mercy on him, he commanded the door to be replaced with a new one made of pure gold, which is currently in place. For a long time, the door had been opened irregularly, which was dangerous to the lives of those who were in the crowd. This led to the door being opened only twice a year. The first time is in the month of Sha’ban, for washing the Kaaba, and the second time is at the beginning of Dhul-Hijjah, for washing the Kaaba and hanging the new Kiswah.`,
